this tut will be mostly about theory
we need to talk about access of tiles from tilesets in the world in the game
we will work with data in a 2d grid
demonstrates with a 4-4 tile map of a fake mini world
we want to access tiles and map mouse coordinates into the square space
we need to convert back-and-forth between 'in-game tile map view' (the grid)
and a linear index
5 is tile 1,1 (in a 4x4 grid)
its good to start from zero so we dont need to keep subtracting 1
ok.. 
6:15:
"I WILL NOW EXPLAIN 3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF COORD SYSTEM TRANSLATIONS/TRANSFORMATIONS"
1) switching from mouse coords into the tile space on our map
2) taking the map coords that we have just calculated,
 and taking the index value of 7,
  based on the value of 3 and 1
3) the reversal of coord system translation #2, 
in which we will take from index 7 of the map,
and we'll use only this value alone, 
without anything else, 
other than the width 
of the tilemap,
in order to go back and reverse the process, 
and turn 7 into x=3 and y=1

THE FIRST THING TO LOOK AT: MOUSE-TO-TILE COORDS

that means: we are taking these values
 and 
 trying to decide
  which  tile it belongs to
  on both axis, both x,y it belongs to
 
we calculate it by taking the mouse position at x (which is 52), and 
dividing it by the width of the tile??
and that will result in

11:45 FINALLY MOVE ON TO TWO
