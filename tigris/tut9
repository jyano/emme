overview
we have already started an engine for rpg games
lets improve our sprite rendering engine
overview
1)resolve frame counter conflict between animated Spite objs
(seen in previous tut)
2)precreation of 320000 anim counters
a)resetting global anim counter on every frame
b)increasing global anim counter on Spite draw method
3)Creation of new Anim js obj
4) addition of new animation.js
5)addition of new spritesheet.js 
6) but its mostly about impvoements of sprite.js drawing functions
(containing the main sprite obj)
7)reuse spritesheets without having to reload them more than once
2:30 main theme is drawing/anim sprites with our engine
-using global animation counters we will avoid anim collisions (seen prev)
-new Spritesheet obj located in new spritesheet.js
-reusing Spite obj dog iwth CHACHED sprite sheet image
3:30 originally we had a sprite obj in our engine
it contains an image
that is the image usually displayed on on canvas
new sprite sheet object! we will attach it to our sprite oubject.
this ss object will also contain an img
so now
the sprite obj can chose which img to use
our orig sprite object had draw method for use on img that is 
originally attached to sprite obj
but now
draw fn will AUTOMATICALLY (once we program it)
 chose the img that is available
in other words, if our sprite object was created with a spritesheet, then it will
use the image from the spritesheet, etc
