NOTE: TUT3 IS NOT MEANT TO BE RUNNABLE
how to start creating tilemap world in js
-
my game features collision detection, sprite animation, can destroy tiles (with mouse),
build your own worlds, tile editor (missing right now)
also, collision degree on two different slopes (45dg, 30dg, etc)
gravity applied (in both direction)
camera movement brings you to next screen
1:23 no climbing yet (cant go down ladder yet)
posts in tut3 but is really tut2 code //http://jsfiddle.net/dzuwLr8t/43/
1:36 "thats (ladder time)  when i said time to stop programming, and time to make a tutorial"

talks about why he didn't use any "gamemakers"

1408 'THERE IS ANOTHER PRINCIPLE I WANT TO SHOW YOU. SNAPPING MOUSE TO GRID'

1512 "ITS ACTUALLY PRETTY SIMPLE"

first we need to identify 
within the grid space,
 NOT THE MOUSE SPACE,
  but within the tilespace,
  where that cell is  which the mouse is pointing to.
to do that, 
we need to convert mouse corrds in the screen space..
first we need to map it to this local box, which is the screen
..
15:12 GOES TO SOURCE GOOD 'its actually pretty simple'
first u define cell w/h, which is 32 * 32
i'm using jquery mousemove event
gets offset..
finds out if map is within the box (LOCAL to this screen..)
1559 what we need to do is,
we need to take the x,y we just got from that space
and divide it by width
and use M.fl or it
and that will give u the number of cells within that space
so we need to multiple to find the final position
of the snapped cell (by w/h for x,y)
so that will check if the value is within the space of the screen
where the game is
not the browser screen
draw the tile there 
using the ..
 
17:25 "this is just ONe way to do this, not only way"
this is great for tilemapbuilders !!!
1800 you can create the entire world like this if you have a large enough tileset
