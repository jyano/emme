 my thoughts:
 filling with pattern is more sophisticated because it lets me draw within vector shapes because
 the image is drawn by a fill.. just like we normally use to color something in
 .. but cant drawImage have the same effect via clipping or destination-out/in/whatever?
 ///////
 more:
 the difference between drawImage and pattern filling an image is that
 pattern filling only draws within the current path, and drawImage ignores the current path
 (however, they both must obey CLIPPING PATH)

 each sprite is 32x32 pixels
 
 45: 'we need to initialize Context'
 talks about how png's are great for sprites with transparancy

 38: shows final result in canvas (with animation and all!)
 
 he uses a 'sprite' called wall.png

 315"i'm gonna draw a js object called Spite and give it functions so that we 
  can load images into it and then it can draw 'sprites' on the actual canvas
 ////////////////////
 
  start at 3:46 " NOW I'M READY TO START WRTING THE SPITE FUNC!!!" !!!
  9:15 at this point we have successfully LOADED a sprite
 9:17 goes to back to some images of sprites
  then says there are FOUR  ways to draw a sprite
  
 
  draw -> normal
  draw and specify w/h -> stretch
  
  special tiled flag -> tiled ?(like html backgrounds)
  specify x,y, and angle -> rotated
  after this tut u will be able to implement thse FOUR WAYS using thseTHREE functions
 10:50 GOES BACK TO CODE lets add functions that draw. lets go back to code and add functions, starting with 'draw method'

  15:30 before we move on the next function (rt), i wanna explain something
  blah blah blah..
  21:17 "AS A FINAL STEP, ILL SHOW U HOW TO USE THE CODE WE JUST WROTE"
